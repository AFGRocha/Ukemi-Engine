# Sakuga-Engine
Sakuga Engine is (another) fighting game engine project of mine. The goal is to make a simple and versatile framework to create my own anime fighting games.
## Yeah, but why creating a new one?
My previous attempt (AFF) was functional, but I made a lot of dumb decisions which made adding new features a pain in the ass... I'm making this one to remove as much tech debt from AFF I can and trying new ideas and be more thoughtful about how I make stuff.
### And port it to Godot 4!
Godot 3 lacks a lot of features and has a lot of problems that Godot 4 solves, with some quality of life improvements that I really miss in the older version.
I was planning to migrate since a while, so let's see how it goes.
## Features?
When I got something to show I'm gonna update this
